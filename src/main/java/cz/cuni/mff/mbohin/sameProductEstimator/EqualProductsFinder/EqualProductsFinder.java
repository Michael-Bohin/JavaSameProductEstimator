/**
 * The EqualProductsFinder class is responsible for identifying and sorting probable equal products
 * between multiple e-shops (Kosik, Rohlik, and Tesco). This class uses various similarity measures
 * such as substring similarity, prefix similarity, longest common subsequence, and length-adjusted edit distance
 * to compare and match products across these e-shops.
 * It initializes by asserting that the provided lists of normalized products belong to their e-shops and
 * prepares the output directories for logging. The core functionalities are:
 * - Asynchronously processing and sorting probable equal products between the e-shops using multithreading.
 * - Comparing products from smaller e-shops against larger e-shops to optimize the matching process.
 * - Logging the results of the similarity comparisons for further analysis.
 * The class also provides methods to clean up old log files, calculate various similarity metrics,
 * and ensure unique file paths for logging results.
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * List<NormalizedProduct> kosikProducts = ...;
 * List<NormalizedProduct> rohlikProducts = ...;
 * List<NormalizedProduct> tescoProducts = ...;
 * EqualProductsFinder finder = new EqualProductsFinder(kosikProducts, rohlikProducts, tescoProducts);
 * finder.sortProbableEqualProductsAsync();
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Note: The class assumes that product names are normalized using specific adapters of eshops.
